# Global-Liar-Dataset

## Dataset Description
The Global-Liar dataset is a curated collection of statements that are regionally, label-, and cut-off-date balanced. This dataset comprises both true and false statements, all published before and after the OpenAI training cut-off date for models in September 2021. It is crafted to circumvent potential biases from datasets possibly used in model fine-tuning and to address the prevalent Western-centric focus of existing datasets.

### Key Features
- **Balance**: Ensures equal representation of six global regions: Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Latin America, North America, and the Middle East.
- **Diversity**: Contains 100 statements from each region, amounting to a broad spectrum of perspectives.
- **Temporal Relevance**: Includes statements from periods before and after the widely recognized AI training cut-off, enhancing its relevance for current models.
- **Evaluation**: Designed for a nuanced and comprehensive evaluation of fact-checking performance of AI models, particularly those beyond Western datasets.

The datasetâ€™s structure allows for comprehensive assessments across different dimensions, such as regional veracity and temporal relevance, offering a unique resource for advancing fact-checking AI research.
